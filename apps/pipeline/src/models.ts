   * Dream step — replaced `kwaivgi/kling-v3-omni-video` (phase 2's pick

   * Deforum output on the external drive frame-by-frame: contrary to this

   * structure/layout tightly to the real footage after the first few
   * frames (a boardwalk stays a boardwalk, a treeline stays a treeline)

   * reference variations, it either left frames almost untouched or
   * cross-dissolved the whole frame into the reference image's own
   * content, erasing the person rather than reimagining them.
   *
   * `black-forest-labs/flux-kontext-dev` — a prompt-driven image *editor*,
   * not a generic img2img model — reproduces the real pattern almost
   * exactly when called per real frame (not per scene): same pose,
   * composition, and background, fully repainted. This is the same model
   * that lost the artwork-step comparison to DiffusionCLIP (see
   * `artwork` above) — but that comparison was about matching
   * DiffusionCLIP's specific watercolor look, which it resisted; here
   * there's no fixed look to match, so its actual strength (structure-
   * locked, prompt-driven reimagining) is exactly what's needed. Called
   * once per *kept* frame at a reduced step-fps (see `dream.ts`), not
   * once per scene — Kling's one-call-per-scene shape is why it could
   * never track real per-frame motion, no matter the prompt.
