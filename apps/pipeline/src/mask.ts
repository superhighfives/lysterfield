 * Worked at a fixed size, so the grow/blur amounts don't depend on the
 * alpha's resolution. Earlier values (100 dilation passes, sigma 30) were
 * applied at whatever resolution the alpha came in at, which was 2160px
 * for both real jobs: about 47px/sigma 14 in panel terms. Bumped after
 * full-video's pilot: DiffusionCLIP's painterly arms smear well past the
 * true silhouette, and during fast arm moves those smears showed through
 * the old mask's soft edge into panel 3.
 *
 * Passing several alphas (a keyframe's whole hold window) makes the mask
 * cover everywhere the subject goes during that window, not just one pose.
