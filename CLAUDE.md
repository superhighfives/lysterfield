Baseline rules live in [superhighfives/control-room](https://github.com/superhighfives/control-room/blob/main/BASELINE.md).
This file is the repo-specific part.

## Layout

Bun workspaces: `apps/client` (Vite/React/R3F player) and `apps/pipeline`
(Node/TS CLI, Replicate-driven — see
`plans/in-progress/rebuild-pipeline-as-replicate-cli.md`). Install and run
workspace scripts from the repo root with `bun run --cwd apps/<name> <script>`.
`bunfig.toml` pins the hoisted linker — bun's default isolated linker's
node_modules layout breaks `eslint-import-resolver-typescript`'s module
resolution. Don't remove that setting without re-checking lint still passes.

## Generated assets — never commit

Per-scene output (`apps/client/dreams/<id>/...`: composited videos, loop
clips, preview JPGs) and any pipeline working directories (extracted frames,
per-step Replicate outputs) are generated, not source. They're already
gitignored in `apps/client`; keep the same rule for anything `apps/pipeline`
writes.

`apps/pipeline/.jobs` and `apps/pipeline/.env` are shared across git worktrees:
`.githooks/post-checkout` symlinks a new worktree's copies to the main
checkout's on `git worktree add`.
It needs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` set once per clone. For a
worktree that already exists, run `.githooks/post-checkout` from inside it.

## Job layout

A job (`apps/pipeline/.jobs/<name>/`) is `job.json` (fps, source, stepFps,
a per-panel provenance note), `0-source/` (`original/`, `video.mov`,
`frames/`), and one numbered folder per panel with its final frames in
`<n>-<panel>/frames`. Each dream take is `7-dreams/<id>/` with its own
`take.json` and a `final/` folder of publishable output. `<id>` is the
client's dream id (readable, e.g. `lush-and-light`), and everything in the
client keys off it. `.jobs/spikes/` holds experiment leftovers only.

`.jobs/full-video` reuses the legacy run's panels (see
`plans/done/phase-4e-full-video-source-prep.md`): the legacy `resized`
folder had stray leftover frames, so check reused frames before feeding
them to a model.

## Replicate calls cost money

Pipeline steps run over source video at up to 60fps and can mean thousands of
per-frame API calls for a single scene. Never add retry loops, "just try it
again" fallbacks, or code paths that call a Replicate model without an
idempotency check (skip-if-output-exists) guarding it first.

## The client's 7-panel output order is load-bearing, not a convention

`apps/client/src/materials/video-material.tsx` and `apps/client/src/views/main.tsx`
read a fixed `uFrameTotal={7}` atlas at hardcoded indices: 1 = lyrics,
2 = portrait, 3 = portrait background, 4 = matte, 5 = depth, 6 = outline,
7 = dream video. Don't reorder or resize the pipeline's composite output
without updating both those files to match.

## Dream panel (7) must never show a person

Abstract reinterpretation only — shapes, light, and colour, never a
recognisable person or face. `dream.ts` always appends a fixed
`NO_PEOPLE_SUFFIX` to every take's prompt so this can't be forgotten
per-take; don't bypass that by calling the model directly with a raw
prompt. Both dream takes in `real-15s-60fps` (`dream-styletransfer-v2`,
`dream-styletransfer-v2-fixed`) failed review for exactly this reason — a
per-take prompt alone wasn't a strong enough guarantee.

## Known per-frame artifact failure modes

- **Matte (panel 4, `robust_video_matting`)**: occasionally glitches for a
  second or two — a bad mask on a run of frames. Options being evaluated:
  pre-contrasting input frames before matting, swapping to a newer
  segmentation model, or a spot-check pass before a bad matte run feeds
  `background-plate`/`compose`. Don't assume a completed matte run is
  artifact-free.
- **Depth (panel 5, `zoedepth`)**: sometimes adds flutter/artifacts in the
  corners. Worth checking whether a newer depth model is a straightforward
  swap.

See `plans/backlog/frame-preview-approval-tool.md` for the planned
per-scene review workflow these feed into.

## Secrets

`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` and friends live in `apps/pipeline/.env`, never
committed. No hardcoded hostnames for local model servers (the old pipeline's
`superuniverse.local` — that pattern is retired, not ported).
